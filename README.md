# MovieWatchList-App

## Overview

Welcome to the **MovieWatchList-App**! Whether you're a movie enthusiast or just looking for something fun to watch, this application has got you covered.

The MovieWatchList-App is a Java Spring Boot project that provides a platform for users to manage their movie watchlists. It leverages various technologies such as Spring Boot, Spring Data, MVC architecture, Thymeleaf, and H2 Database to deliver a seamless experience for users. Additionally, the app integrates with the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) to fetch detailed movie information, allowing users to compare their ratings with those on the OMDb website and update their watchlist accordingly.

## Features

- **RESTful API**: The application provides a set of RESTful APIs for interacting with movie data. These APIs allow users to fetch existing movies and add new movies to their watchlists.

- **Spring Boot MVC**: The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, where models represent the data, views display the data to the user, and controllers handle user requests and generate responses.

- **H2 Database**: The application uses an H2 Database, an in-memory database, to store and retrieve movie data. This allows for efficient data management without the need for external database setups.

- **Thymeleaf**: Thymeleaf is used as the template engine to create dynamic and responsive web pages for user interaction. It seamlessly integrates with Spring Boot to generate HTML content based on server-side processing.

- **OMDb API Integration**: The application integrates with the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) to fetch detailed movie information, including ratings, plot summaries, and more. This allows users to compare their ratings with those on the OMDb website and update their watchlist accordingly.

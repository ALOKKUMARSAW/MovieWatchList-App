# Movie Watchlist Application

![Movie Watchlist Logo](https://example.com/movie_watchlist_logo.png)

Welcome to the Movie Watchlist Application! Whether you're a movie enthusiast or just looking for something fun to watch, this application has got you covered.

## Overview

The Movie Watchlist Application is a Java Spring Boot project that provides a platform for users to manage their movie watchlists. It leverages various technologies such as Spring Boot, Spring Data, MVC architecture, Thymeleaf, and H2 Database to deliver a seamless experience for users.

## Features

### RESTful API

The application provides a set of RESTful APIs for interacting with movie data. These APIs allow users to fetch existing movies and add new movies to their watchlists.

### Spring Boot MVC

The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, where models represent the data, views display the data to the user, and controllers handle user requests and generate responses.

### H2 Database

The application uses an H2 Database, an in-memory database, to store and retrieve movie data. This allows for efficient data management without the need for external database setups.

### Thymeleaf

Thymeleaf is used as the template engine to create dynamic and responsive web pages for user interaction. It seamlessly integrates with Spring Boot to generate HTML content based on server-side processing.
